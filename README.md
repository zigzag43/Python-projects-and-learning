This Python project, created for learning purposes, includes a Face Recognition Attendance System and a QR Code Scanner Attendance System using OpenCV. The face recognition system logs attendance by identifying faces in real time or from saved images, while the QR code scanner allows quick attendance logging by scanning individuals' unique codes. The backend utilizes MySQL for robust database management and Excel for additional data storage options, making it adaptable and practical. Additionally, the project includes a collection of smaller Python projects developed during the learning process, demonstrating a wide range of programming and computer vision skills
